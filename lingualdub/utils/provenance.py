    Build a Result's provenance from the upstream input's, plus this stage's own keys.

    Components that construct a fresh ``Result`` with a literal ``provenance={...}``
    silently drop upstream keys — most damagingly ``consent_basis``, which later
    stages use to decide whether voice data may be processed. Echoing the input
    provenance through makes that class of bug impossible to write by accident.

        input_obj: The upstream ``Resource``, ``Result``, or anything else.

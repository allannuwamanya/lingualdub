## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- **M0 — Core Foundation**: `Language`, `Resource`, `Component`, `Pipeline`, `Result`, and `Segment` domain abstractions with JSON serialization, `ResourceManager` caching with SHA256 integrity, `Registry` with conflict policies, and `ManifestScanner` extension discovery.
- **M1 — First Real Pipeline**: Luganda $\to$ English baseline with Sunbird ASR/MT, OpenAI Whisper, and Meta MMS-TTS adapters, plus offline dummy adapters.
- **M2 — Evaluation Infrastructure**: `WEREvaluator`, `TranslationEvaluator` (BLEU & chrF), dataset resources, and reproducible `compare_runs` utility.
- **M3 — Code-Switching**: Heuristic LID, word-level timestamp segmentation, and automatic per-segment language routing in `PipelineExecutor`.
- **M4 — Temporal Alignment**: Forced alignment (`DummyForcedAlignmentComponent`), duration modelling, and speech-rate control (`FittingStrategy`).
- **M5 — Voice Retention Evaluation**: `SpeakerEmbeddingComponent`, `SpeakerSimilarityEvaluator` (cosine similarity), and mandatory consent verification (`ensure_consent`).
- **M6 — Cross-Lingual Voice Transfer**: `VoiceConditionedTTSComponent` conditioned on speaker reference with consent enforcement.
- **M7 — Audio-Visual Synchronisation**: `AVSyncEvaluator`, `DialogueTimingComponent`, and `VideoMergerComponent` with `.mp4` artifact creation.
- **M8 — Generalisation Proof**: Complete Runyankole (`nyn`) speech-to-speech transfer proof with zero framework core modifications.
- **M9 — Stable v0.1.0 Release**: Standardized Apache 2.0 licensing, PyPI publishing pipeline, updated documentation site, and complete contributor guide.
- **Framework Hardening (FND/LCY/EXE/EXT/REL/PRO/PEV)**: Unified exception hierarchy (`RegistryError`/`ResourceNotFoundError` single source), strict `ResultStatus` monotonicity (`COMPLETE→PARTIAL→DEGRADED→FAILED`), lifecycle shutdown reverse-execution order, `Registry` versioned-cache, `docs/lifecycle.md`, observability and validation hardening, and performance caches.
- **M10 — Cross-Lingual Voice Retention**: `SpeakerEmbeddingComponent` with a SpeechBrain ECAPA-TDNN backend (deterministic offline fallback), and `VoiceConditionedTTSComponent` wrapping Coqui XTTS-v2 for zero-shot cross-lingual voice cloning.
- **M11 — Seamless Code-Switching Synthesis**: `NeuralLIDComponent` (transformer-based language ID) replacing the heuristic as the default LID stage, and `AudioBlendingComponent`, which cross-fades per-language synthesised audio to avoid clicks at language boundaries.
- **M12 — Duration-Constrained Synthesis**: `AudioTimeStretchComponent` for duration-constrained TTS time-stretching, letting dialogue pacing hit target timings without resynthesis.
- **M13 — Data Flywheel**: `DataFlywheelComponent` detects low-confidence and degraded segments, extracts audio snippets, and exports structured JSONL correction samples for active learning.
- **`dub` CLI command**: single-command dubbing entry point with subtitle generation and muxing, plus manifest registration for all M10–M13 components.

### Fixed
- Justify all `ValueError` raises with `# justified` per `FND-002` verification.
- Harden `Registry` and `ResourceManager` exception re-exports to single canonical source.
- Prevent `DEGRADED→PARTIAL` regression in `PipelineExecutor` mixed-failure cascades.
- Sync `PUBLIC_API.md` with `SecurityConfig` and observability symbols.
- Remove internal `_MISSING` from public `lingualdub.di` exports.
